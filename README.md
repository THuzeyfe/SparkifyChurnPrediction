# Sparkify Churn Prediction
## Project Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to build a data capstone project for Udacity course via pyspark. In the project, approximately 2-month data of Sparkify application is used to predict churned users. Three machine learning model is used.
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
## Install
Python 3 programming language. All necessary libraries are installed within the program. Moreover, PySPark is also used so ome additional installations can be needed.
## File Descriptions
* **sparkify.ipynb:** This is a python file that includes all the codes. All visualizations, modeling etc. is done in the the file.
* **mini_sparkify_event_Data.json:** This is json file that includes all logs of users. Logs shows all activies like listened songs, errors etc.
* **licence.txt:** The licence file.
* **README.md:** The information file you are currently reading.
